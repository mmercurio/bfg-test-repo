# This File Does not Exist

After this file is merged to a PR branch, pushed to the remote, and then merged to the `main` branch, it will be deleted from existence using `bfg`.

It's my expectation that there will be no evidenve of the contents of this file. For example, pretend that it accidentally contained some senstive information such as a secure API key.

Oh no. What now?
